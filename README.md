# course-Bayesian Network

Romantic relationships in real life are often complex, and sometimes people are eager to know the probability of ending up with someone of the opposite sex. To address this, we created a Bayesian Network to help calculate the final probability, which includes factors such as both parties' values, family background, education level, and more. This project incorporates algorithms like Belief Propagation and Variable Elimination, and features a user-friendly visualization process. This Bayesian Network provides a new tool for people in making relationship choices.
